# Python-3-sectored-base-station
This Python application models the downlink behavior of a 3 sectored base station in a dynamic environment and varying design parameters. 
It tracks important cellular parameters such as no. of dropped calls, Received Signal levels (RSL), no. of successful calls etc and prints them out at specified time intervals. 
This information can be used to arrive at the optimal design parameters under a given condition.
